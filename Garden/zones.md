# Zones

Permaculture has the concept of `Zones`.

Zones are part of the decision making matrix. Zones are concerned with the level of human activity, efficiency of movement, and human effort on a Permaculture site. This page defines and explores the zone concept.

> Zones are numbered from 0 to 5, and represent the intensity of use of these spaces in the design. Zone 0 is the house, or home center. Zone 1 is the zone nearest to the house, which would receive the most intensive management. Zone 5 is un-managed wilderness, or out-edges of the property. [^1]

## Zone 0

Zone 0 is the house, or home center. This is where we live and where we will be doing most of our work. This is where we will be doing our planning and where we will be storing our tools and supplies.

## Zone 1

Zone 1 is the zone nearest to the house, which would receive the most intensive management. This is where we will be growing our most used plants and where most of our purely aesthetic plants will be located.

> most used plants: such as herbs and vegetables, raised beds, flowers, and vertical gardens.

## Zone 2
