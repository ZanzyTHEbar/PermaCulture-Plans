## Introduction

`Serta` is within plant hardiness [zone 9a to zone 10a][7].  This means that we can grow a wide variety of plants.  However, we must be careful to select plants that are appropriate for our climate.  We must also consider the soil, sunlight, water, and wind conditions of our garden.

Developing a garden plan is a complex task.  There are many factors to consider, including:

- [Soil][2]
- [Climate][3]
- [Sunlight][4]
- [Water][5]
- [Wind][6]

We are going to implement the following concepts:

- [Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)
- [Agroforestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroforestry)
- [Forest gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening)
- [Food forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_forest)
- [Forest farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_farming)
-[Syntropic Agroforestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntropic_agriculture)

We will be utilizing the [permaculture][1] principles of:

- [Observe and Interact](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_1/)
- [Catch and Store Energy](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_2/)
- [Obtain a Yield](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_3/)
- [Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_4/)
- [Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_5/)
- [Produce No Waste](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_6/)
- [Design From Patterns to Details](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_7/)
- [Integrate Rather Than Segregate](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_8/)
- [Use Small and Slow Solutions](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_9/)
- [Use and Value Diversity](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_10/)
- [Use Edges and Value the Marginal](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_11/)
- [Creatively Use and Respond to Change](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_12/)

Along with these principles, we will be subdividing the garden into zones:

- [Zones](https://open.oregonstate.education/permaculture/chapter/zones/)

Each zone will have a specific purpose and will be designed to meet that purpose as a part of the overall garden plan.
