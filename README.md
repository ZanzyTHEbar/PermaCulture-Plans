## Introduction

`Serta` is within plant hardiness [zone 9a to zone 10a][7].  This means that we can grow a wide variety of plants.  However, we must be careful to select plants that are appropriate for our climate.  We must also consider the soil, sunlight, water, and wind conditions of our garden.

Developing a garden plan is a complex task.  There are many factors to consider, including:

- [Soil][2]
- [Climate][3]
- [Sunlight][4]
- [Water][5]
- [Wind][6]

We are going to implement the following concepts:

- [Permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)
- [Agroforestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agroforestry)
- [Forest gardening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening)
- [Food forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_forest)
- [Forest farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_farming)
-[Syntropic Agroforestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntropic_agriculture)

We will be utilizing the [permaculture][1] principles of:

- [Observe and Interact](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_1/)
- [Catch and Store Energy](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_2/)
- [Obtain a Yield](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_3/)
- [Apply Self Regulation and Accept Feedback](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_4/)
- [Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_5/)
- [Produce No Waste](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_6/)
- [Design From Patterns to Details](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_7/)
- [Integrate Rather Than Segregate](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_8/)
- [Use Small and Slow Solutions](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_9/)
- [Use and Value Diversity](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_10/)
- [Use Edges and Value the Marginal](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_11/)
- [Creatively Use and Respond to Change](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/_12/)

Along with these principles, we will be subdividing the garden into zones:

- [Zones](https://open.oregonstate.education/permaculture/chapter/zones/)

Each zone will have a specific purpose and will be designed to meet that purpose as a part of the overall garden plan.

## How to Design a Permaculture Property

- Start with yourself and get a clear idea of what relevant skills and knowledge you have along with your strengths.

- Identify your vision and goals because clear intentions speed both design and implementation, prevent wasted effort and save time.

- List your personal resources and limitations to know how much time, money, and energy you can devote to the project.

- Get a base map, it’s the base layer and it forms the basis for the design – acquire one easily from Google Earth or Google Maps.

- Collect info about your site from direct observations on the field and off- site resources such as books, local experts and the internet.

- Conduct an analysis and assessment of your site to gain a deeper understanding of each aspect of it.

- Summarize the info from the site analysis and assessment into a rough sketch to see if your goals are attainable.

- Begin designing with a concept design and determine the relative placement and proportioning of the areas, use zone & sector planning and work through the scale of permanence.

- Go into details with the detail design – determining size, shapes and locations of individual elements, use needs & yields and random assembly methods to determine how to connect pieces of design.

- Make a plan for implementation; a plan of action to follow based on your priorities, budget and logical order of establishment, remember to plan in accordance to the scale of permanence.
