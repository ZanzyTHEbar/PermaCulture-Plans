## Inspirations

### Japanese

1. Lots of Undulating Sculptural Forms
   1. Use `Soleirolia soleirolii` as an alternative to moss used in Japanese gardens, taking advantage of its naturally mounding, creeping habit to create the impression of the Japanese hills our client loved. `Soleirolia soleirolii` is a vigorous, low maintenance ground cover plant, which looks fantastic in tropical, lush or shady gardens. It is good in part shade or shade, providing the soil is consistently moist but well-drained.
2. Choose Bamboo Features
   1. Young green Moso poles make a neat, curving low fence when bent over and tied in place with knotted black twine – perfect for lining pathways or protecting precious areas such as delicate moss gardens or raked gravel areas. Giant poles – often up to 10mm or more in diameter – are useful for pergolas and shelters and can also be lashed together to create lightweight platforms.
   2. [How to grow Bamboo](https://www.gardeningetc.com/advice/how-to-grow-bamboo)
   3. Use Bamboo for channelling water, creating fencing, privacy panels, archways, pathways, wind chimes.
3. Plant up a rockery outcrop
   1. Natural Stone
   2. Fine gravel paths weaving through rocky outcrops, planted with low growing sedums, alpines, azaleas and statuesque conifers
4. Consider Dark or even black back-drops
   1. Painted garden wall ideas, porcelain paving tiles or a wall clad in charred timber, it will create the perfect backdrop for highlighting minimal-style furniture and richly toned planting.
   2. Lush, glossy foliage and the intense orange, crimson leaves of `acers` are all accentuated by this dark, moody shade and it will also throw the intricate-shaped foliage into sharp relief too.
5. Showcase Bonsai and Miniature Bonsai
   1. The basic principles for estimating your ideal pot size are relative to your bonsai tree. The pot at its longest side should measure half the tree's height and the depth is equivalent to the width of trunk at the soil base. Chunky bonsai trees are better suited to square pots, whilst the more delicate trees in circular pots.
6. Use `Acers`
   1. Acers in rockeries, near corners, as shade providers
   2. Acer varieties to start with
      1. `Acer palmatum 'Sango-kaku` Coral Bark maple Pale green, deeply cut leaves that turn butter yellow in autumn. New shoots emerge bright red.
      2. `Acer palmatum 'Osakazuki` Perhaps the brightest of them all with bright green leaves that turn vivid scarlet in autumn.
      3. `Acer palmatum 'Butterfly` Perfect for a pot, this upright tree grows to 3 meters high and has delicate green-grey variegated leaves with a touch of pink.
      4. `Acer palmatum 'Garnet` Fine, almost feathery leaves that fade from deep claret to intense scarlet. The sculptural dome shape looks spectacular overhanging water.
      5. `Acer japonicum Vitifolium` Vine leaved Japanese maple Large green fan-shaped foliage gives this variety tons of impact. Leaves change in fall to fiery tones of yellow, orange and red.
   3. [How to grow acers](https://www.gardeningetc.com/advice/how-to-grow-acers-for-year-round-interest-in-your-garden)
7. Bridge
8. Stone Lanterns
9. Strolling Garden
   1. Using raised curving walkways made from rich-toned hardwood deckboards, the rectangular space is divided into five distinct planting areas each with their own planting palette and signature scent. Rounded shrubs and grassy hillocks echo the curvy design and increase the sense of movement.
   2. Use fitting pathways, can be deckboards or other.
   3. Shaka Tsukubai next to a stone water basin in a garden while each basin is surrounded by three kneeling stones or large flat rocks
   4. Fewer thoughtfully placed features is better than many chaotic features.
10. Arrange a Gravel and Rock Garden
    1. Choose a pale, cool shade of gravel – dove gray, white marble and silver blue granite all work well – and go for 6mm stones laid 75mm deep for defined raked lines.
    2. Feature stones and rocks are arranged in groups of three, five or seven. Chosen for their individual shapes, markings and color they are placed within the flat graveled area to represent key landscape features such as waterfalls, trees, mountains and even animals. Moss and lichen are encouraged to grow on the surfaces and the occasional small evergreen tree or conifer are sometimes added on the garden’s fringes.
11. Mix stark and contrasting materials
    1. black basalt was used for the path surface, and grey granite slabs were inserted to give the illusion of a bridge crossing water, which is itself represented by granite gravel. Granite boulders complete the illusion of a stream running between rocky banks.

#### Japanese Style Notes

> [!NOTE]\
> Hard landscaping ideas can include gravel, rocks and stepping-stones to provide plenty of contrasting texture and surfaces underfoot. Try tying pieces of bamboo together with black twine to create simple arches, gates, fences, and privacy panels.
> Encourage mosses to spread in nooks and crannies and plant clump forming grasses and shrubs for undulating foliage and to showcase the various restful shades of green.
> [Landscaping Ideas](https://www.gardeningetc.com/design/landscaping-ideas)
>Aim for a mix of graveled and planted areas so you can experiment with textured surfaces and planting in your Japanese garden ideas.
> Stepping stones weaving their way to a pond or sculptural focal point – a stone lantern or water basin – are ideal for creating movement and interest and encourage visitors to view the space from different angles.
>Foliage plants such as ferns and Fatsia japonica will thrive in damp, shady spots and add plenty of shape and texture while softer, undulating stars like the grass Hakonechloa macra, common box and colorful pieris are happy in a sunny situation.
>Complete your [Zen garden ideas](https://www.gardeningetc.com/design/zen-garden-ideas) with a few eye-popping features such as potted bonsai, a cloud-pruned shrub or bamboo water feature.

### Mediterranean

Pale gravel, tiled patios and walls painted in vibrant shades of terracotta, mustard, azure blue and white all instantly conjure up the mood of these sun-soaked spaces.

Plant with fragrant and silver-leaved beauties such as `santolina`, `Caryopteris` `clandonensis`, `artemesia` and of course – `lavender` and add in potted feature plants such as a stately `Chusan palm` or `olive tree`.

Scented and glossy leaved climbers clambering over a pergola will provide shade for an atmospheric spot for dining. When dotted with flickering lanterns, come evening, it will be hard to recall whether you are at home or away.

1. Tuscan Inspired Outdoor Kitchen
   1. Rustic-style
   2. Deep terracotta details with pare-back furniture
   3. Decorative paving
   4. Wooden pergola

   2. Use the same plants repeatedly, use fewer plants
   3. Neat, mound-like growing habits – lavender and santolina for example
   4. Repeating cistus, eryngium, hebe and euphorbia though the space.
   5. Masses of potted pelargonium's. Vibrant beauties to liven up dull corners, a flight of steps or to pep up borders of silver-leaved stars such as lavender and rosemary. Although there are plenty of vivid shades to choose from, stick to the same color for maximum impact
3. Choose Low maintenance gravel
   1. Pale-colored gravel. Water-permeable weed-suppressing membrane underneath, it's a quick and easy, low-maintenance way of transforming even the most unpromising of spaces.
   2. Soften the edges where gravel meets a pathway by allowing thyme, oregano or marjoram to spill over onto it
   3. Add extra interest by arranging large stones and small boulders in a naturalistic way across the gravel
   4. Angular chippings between `10mm` and `20mm` for _garden path_ ideas or areas where you are likely to walk, as this size is less likely to get caught in wheels and under shoes. Finer shingle, measuring between `6mm` to `8mm`, is perfect for spreading around plants and on _borders_.
4. Create Shady zones for sitting
   1. Introduce climbers
   2. Use pergola's
   3. Use lots of fragrance near sitting areas
5. Paint Pergola's black and red
   1. Adds drama and structure
   2. Contrasts flowers and foliage using a dark back-drop
6. Use large pots often
   1. Oversized pots and planters are characteristic of Mediterranean garden ideas and terracotta is the obvious choice, with its warm color, tactile feel and ability to soak up and reflect back the heat of the summer sun
   2. Use them to make focal points
   3. Cobalt blue and Sunny Yellow tones for pots mixed with terracotta
      1. Use Masonry paint
         1. Little Greene's Mambo or Route One
7. Mix in mediterranean colors
   1. pastels and ochres
      1. great backdrops
   2. Use lots of vibrant colors as backdrops to dull/dark plants like palms
   3. add rustic timber near potted plants and vibrant colors to contrast
   4. Carmine and Smalt look fantastic paired with architectural foliage (green-blues and grey-silvers) and terracotta
   5. Brick walls look great in Ashes of Roses (color name)
   6. Use raw and tactile materials like brick, limestone, acacia
8. Use lots of fragrant species
9. Use architectural foliage and palms/yuccas
10. Use a few soothing water features to contrast the heat and tuscan colors

#### Mediterranean Notes

> [!NOTE]\
> Fig trees produce more fruit when their roots are confined in a pot

#### Flower Beds Notes

1. Use a complementary color palette for a well-balanced look.
2. Make sure your flower bed ideas have something for all seasons, to maintain visual interest all year.
3. Keep on top of weeding and deadheading.
4. Top-dress beds and borders with mulch – bark chippings add a pleasing look.
5. Consider using modern edging to define the space and make maintenance easier
6. Prep your soil before you plant your flower bed ideas. This means removing any perennial weeds to start. And, if it hasn't been planted up before, dig in one or two bucketfuls per square meter of well-rotted farmyard manure or garden compost, as suggests the RHS.

7. Choose your plants carefully by taking the conditions of your garden into account. Don't, for instance, try to coerce a sun-loving plant into your shady border. You'll just end up having to give it extra attention – which will most likely be in vain – before needing to replace it entirely.
8. Go for easy-care perennials – ones you can more-or-less leave, before giving them a quick chop in autumn. You could also opt for hardy annuals – grown from seed they are extremely affordable and often don't need much looking after.
9. Avoid opting for hundreds of different varieties. If you pick a select few, and really get to know them properly, you can deal with them all at the same time. Plus, you'll spend less time having to look up how to maintain them.
10. Don't forget to mulch. It adds extra nutrients to the soil and will also help to prevent weeds from taking over. Our guide to mulching has lots of useful tips.

4. Slot in a corner sofa
5. Introduce a relaxing water feature
6. Use hanging baskets to save floor space
7. Increase the sense of space with a mirror
8. Large sculptural ferns, palms, and euphorbia, as well as flowering plants such as geraniums, will provide a Mediterranean feel. Or, opt for campanula and alliums for a more contemporary look. Make the pots part of the overall theme too.
9. Choose the likes of nicotiana, phlox, and dianthus for containers, and place them near your seating or nearby windows and doors to make the most of the fragrance. They also suggest climbing plants such as honeysuckle and jasmine, which can be wound around a small pergola or trained up trellis ideas for gardens. Pair with a string of solar lights for an even more enchanting look.

### Living Wall

There are three major types of living walls; passive, grow-bags, and kits.

#### Passive

Passive living walls are as simple as a trellis and a climbing/vining plant. Train the plant along the wall, and viola.

#### Grow-Bags

This system uses hanging grow-bags along the wall. This system can provide for more plant choices, non-vining/climbing varieties, however it requires more maintenance and possibly a drip irrigation system.

> [!NOTE]\
> [Example of Hanging Grow-bags](https://www.amazon.es/s?k=hanging+planter+bags)

#### Kits

Kit systems provide everything you need to setup a living wall. They provide ease or use and quick setup, however come at the cost of design flexibility and cost.

#### How-to

1. First, you need to find a space that needs greening up. A living wall is one of the best small garden ideas as it makes the most of what would otherwise be unused vertical space. You can build a living wall on any solid wall or garden fence. They can also be attached to the side of your house or even a sturdy shed.

2. Decide on your planting system. Buy an off-the-shelf hanging pocket planter system or module kit. These usually consist of a rows of small pots or troughs that root into a mat behind, and can be scaled up or down to suit your space. You can also make your own version using old palettes backed with heavy duty polythene (if you’re handy at DIY that is).

3. Once you’ve chosen a structurally sound wall or fence simply attach the planters according to the kit instructions. Some systems require a framework of battens or similar attached to the fence or wall.

4. Attach the plastic planters or modules to the wall, clicking and locking them into place so that you build up your design.

5. Next it's time to green up your wall by adding the plants to your chosen planting system. The best living wall plants add texture, shape, form and color. Use multi-purpose peat-free compost containing a slow release fertilizer to fill the pockets, then start adding a mix of plants of your choice. First decide what arrangement looks best by laying out the plants on the ground and moving them around until you hit on a winning formula, then add them to your planters and water well.

The plants you choose for your living wall depend on the effect you want to achieve and where you're placing it. Spring is a good time to begin, as young plants will quickly get established and start to fill the space. They should be relatively compact or be able to take regular pruning so nothing dominates.

Always include some plants with year round interest too. Here are some suggestions for great plants for a living wall:

- **Herbs** Place your vertical wall close to your kitchen for easy access and herbs will provide ample fresh produce for zinging up your menu, as well as a beautiful scent, while using up little space. The best herbs to try are `thyme`, `chives`, `oregano` and `majoram`, which will all thrive in a sunny spot. There's more tips on how to create a herb garden in our guide.

- **Fruit and vegetables** Lettuce and cut-and-come-again salad leaves such as `rocket`, `mizuna` and `baby spinach` are always a good choice. Find out how to grow `strawberries` and you'll see they look great too, especially a wild variety like `Mara des Bois` which crops all summer. Trailing `tomatoes` and `chilli peppers` do well vertically, while the base of the wall will form a heat trap where crops like `cucumbers` and `aubergines` thrive.

- **Sun and shade tolerant perennials** Hardy perennials will do well in shade and sun, as long as they have enough water if things really start heating up. Try `Bergenia`, `Epimedium`, `Boston ferns`, `hostas` and `Lysimachia nummularia 'Aurea'`, otherwise known as _golden creeping Jenny_.

- **Summer color** Choose a mix of plants such as `campanula`, `lobelia`, `fuchsia`, trailing `pelargonium's`, `Heuchera Purple Petticoats`, `vinca minor` (also known as lesser periwinkle), `ajuga` and `Begonia 'Million Kisses'` to add pops of pretty color to your living wall.

- **Grasses** Varieties such as `Carex oshimensis` ‘Evergold’ (sedge) and succulents like sedum are great for providing year-round interest and texture to fill out your living wall. Grasses also add a tactile quality - you won't be able to pass by without stroking them.

### Garden Walls

1. Espaliered Trees
   1. Great for privacy
   2. Defining zones in a garden
   3. Adding a shot of green along a stone wall or dull backdrop
2. Elevate the mood with eye-catching hues
3. Add whimsical windows to walls
   1. Arched windows are a great way to break up a stretch of walls
4. Sooth a scene with a Water Wall
5. Add extra greenery with wreaths
6. Tiled garden walls to add texture and contrast
7. Play with texture on the wall
8. Wall veneers are a great way to change texture and mood
9. Play with shadows for an emotional impact
10. Mix and match finishes
11. Paint a mural or install mosaic tiles
12. Pep of a wall with hanging baskets and/or pocket planters

### Gravel

1. Use gravel around seating zones
2. Integrate with patio for naturalist edge and more texture
3. Mix with corten steal (or any stair design) for stylish steps
4. Gravel walkways are low-maintenance and easy to replace
5. Great as the base of a rockery

#### Securing Gravel

1. Start by clearing the area where you want to lay your gravel. Dig up any weeds and flatten the soil.
2. Then, set a waterproof membrane down, geo-textile is also a great option. This will prevent weeds from growing up through your gravel, and will help you achieve cleaner edges.
3. Add a gravel pave system (hard-wearing interlocking bases that help keep gravel or stones in a set place.) or use chicken-wire or other wire mesh to secure the gravel. This structure is needed if you're using it for a pathway or driveway ideas. Look for recycled plastic types to be kinder to the environment.
4. Once you've added your gravel, rake it out to make sure it's evenly distributed. It's a good idea to then give the area a rinse down with your best garden hose. This will wash away any dust and get the stones looking their best.
5. Adding edging to your gravelled area will help to prevent it from escaping into the lawn or flowerbeds.

### Log Raised Bed

Figure out the site and then prepare it.

Level the ground and add a small layer of gravel to help drainage and weed.

Each log will be roughly `16cm` in diameter.

A good sized raised bed is `120cm x 240cm`.

Each log should be roughly `35cm` greater than the required dimensions of the bed.

So, a `120cm x 240cm` bed will be `155cm x 275cm`.

A good rule of thumb is 3-layers of logs per bed.

Logs that are `430cm` should work, so that each log can do one side and one end of the bed.

In this way, only 6 logs are needed per bed.

Repeat this process with measurements for smaller or larger beds.

#### How to Build

Rip first layer logs in half length-wise to great the base.

Next, cut divots in every subsequent layer where the layer will mate with the layer below it.

To cut divots in logs, roughly measure the place to cut (eye-balling is fine)and then cut vertical slits with varying depth to create a hemisphere divot. Clean up the burrs and smooth the divot out to great a better mating surface.

In the divot, the deepest depth in the middle with progressively shallower depths going outwards to form a hemisphere shape, best for mating to other logs.

Constantly measure distance using cross-hatch and straight techniques for every layer to ensure a straight bed.

Use a wooden board and a level, or a laser level, to check the level of each layer to ensure there is no deviation.

4 nails at the top-layer corners to hold it together. Top-down.

Pines, hemlock, eucalyptus are best for longevity.

Requires almost no fasteners or drilling.

Looks more rustic.

#### Alternate Method

The log-cabin layout can be achieved by alternating the corners, no divot cuts, but nails/fasteners for each layer at the corners and the tops. Just stagger the joints.

Requires more drilling and less cutting.

Looks more modern and clean.

### Water Wise Design

Passive Water Harvesting Techniques for small garden areas.

Let gravity do the work for us as much as possible.

Slow water down, absorb water into the landscape, store water as much as possible.

1. Mini-Swales
   1. Level trench that is on-contour with the slope of the garden.
   2. Placed strategically to slow and hold water in the landscape.
   3. Utilize garden paths as swales
      1. Catch and hold water during the rain
      2. Organic matter holds water and allows soaking into the ground
      3. Used as paths during dry periods
   4. Prevent swales from flooding plant-zones and drowning roots
      1. Direct swales to sub-soil
      2. Surround planting zones, but ensure planting zones are higher elevation than the swale.
   5. Rise on the down-slope side (berm) plant fruit trees and guilds of perennials.
2. Gravel filled trenches
   1. French Drains
      1. Trench lined with geo-textile and filled with pebbles/gravel.
      2. Approx 15cm deep.
   2. Channel from the drive-way and the over-flow of the rain-water harvesting tank and direct it into gravel-filled tranches next to in-ground beds.
   3. Dig channel deeper as you go up an incline, to ensure the channel is level
      1. Try to ensure that from the water entry to the end of the channel there is a slight slope downwards, if not possible make it level.
   4. End of the water channels should always be a pit containing organic matter and topped with gravel. Of any size small or medium. This will act as a water-store.
3. Wicking Raised Beds
4. Ollas
