## Introduction

Creating a food forest is a large endeavour that requires a lot of planning.  The following steps are a guide to help you plan your food forest.

> _Food forest = Fall in love with pruning and chop and drop._

### Steps

1. Start with the `Why` of the garden plan.
   1. Empowered to provide our nutritional needs, no matter what.
   2. Live among the plants that sustain us.
   3. Live more ecologically.
2. Imagine what we want:
   1. Create vision board.
   2. Collect inspirational images.
   3. Focus on what we want, not what we don't want.
3. Observe the site for `Sectors` and `Zones`.:
   1. Record all of these factors using a `base-map`.
      1. Take a screenshot of the site from Google Maps (or drone aerial footage).
      2. Put it into canva and overlay shapes on all immovable structures (house, driveway, fences, rivers, established trees).
      3. Get detailed, include windows and doors, to show access points and view points.
      4. Remove screenshot from the background.
      5. Put compass on base-map.
      6. Document all observations on this base-map.
   2. Sunlight
      1. Rise and set during solstices and equinoxes.
   3. Water
      1. Rain water.
      2. Grey water.
      3. Septic.
      4. Trenches.
      5. Wells.
      6. Storage.
      7. Hose bibs.
   4. Wind
      1. Prevailing wind directions.
   5. Soil
   6. Climate and Microclimates
      1. Look for microclimates on the site.
   7. Topography
      1. Record the slope of the land.
   8. Views and Vistas
      1. For enjoyment.
      2. Include views we want to hide.
4. Design for Water
   1. Handle Extremes
      1. Floods
      2. Droughts
   2. Capture and Store Water
      1. > **Note**: soil rich in organic matter holds up to 10x it's weight in water
         1. Use fresh copy of base-map to ideate.
      2. Earth Works
         1. Swales on contour
            1. Better for sloped land.
         2. Berms
            1. Plant trees and shrubs on the berm.
         3. Hugelkultur Berms
            1. Better for flat land.
         4. Ponds
         5. Terraces
         6. Keyline
         7. KeyHole
            1. Great with Hugelkultur Berms.
      3. Pond(s).
      4. Rainwater Harvesting
             1. Roof
             2. Driveway
             3. Grey Water
             4. Septic
             5. Trenches
             6. Wells
             7. Storage
             8. Hose bibs
5. Design for Soil
   1. > **Note**: soil is the foundation of the garden.
      1. Use fresh copy of base-map to ideate.
      2. > **Warning**: Never leave the soil exposed, always mulch.
   2. Chop and Drop
      1. > **Note**: chop and drop is the best way to build soil.
      2. Select plants that are good for chop and drop.
         1. > **Note**: chop and drop plants are usually nitrogen fixers, or fast growing plants.
            1. Every Fall prune and drop cuttings in the paths, and along the swales.
            2. Cover with wood chips for a tidier look.

      3. Compost bins.
      4. Hot compost, safely designed to kill weed seeds.
   4. Feed poor soil with compost and mulch.
      1. Start with a soil test for pH.
      2. Add large amounts of compost and wood chips to kick-start.
      3. Include plants for woody and leafy material that will eventually become organic matter sources to eliminate importing materials.

      1. > **Note**: design around what we want to do in the garden, and not what we want the garden to look like.

## Approach

1. Fruit trees first

   These take the longest to establish. I’d spend as much as we could afford on this. If this means growing from seed then so be it, but ideally around 3yo trees. These also form the base for all the other planting and design systems.

2. Mulch mulch mulch

   If possible with a cardboard layer first, but if not, then just mulch as is. It will still improve soil quality and make the weeds easier to pull out in future. The mulch doesn’t have to be very broken down if you’re not planning on planting yet.

   If funds allow, then I would do a 30cm layer of compost first, followed by 20-30cm of mulch.

3. Pick a small area to focus on

   Even in a small garden it can get overwhelming. And I found if plants were too far apart, they would die from the elements. Picking a small area and focusing on that is much less overwhelming if you’re busy. Pick 1-3 areas based on how much time you have, and expand these as they get established.

   During the establishing period, I would just plant heaps of what I know works in our area to stop grass taking over. The plants can always be replaced later.
   Plant lots of select natives for this purpose.

   Never leave the ground bare.

4. Add more mulch every 6-12 months

   Once you have thick established plantings, they will make their own mulch, but for at least the first 3 years you’ll need to physically add mulch.

5. Add Worm Towers to beds and garden areas

   Decreases vermin pressure and feeds/attracts worms to the area.

   Grab a PCV or ceramic/terracotta pipe (15cm diameter).
   Cut the pipe in 50cm sections. Then drill holds into the bottom third of each section.
   > [!NOTE]\
   > A 22mm auger drill bit works the best.
   Drill holes in the top of push-on pcv pipe caps, then attach recycled door handles.
   Cut a slit on the side of the cap, so that it'll be easier to pull off.

   All that is left is to add composting worms (tiger worms) and food scraps.

## Notes

Plant Acacia Stenophylla (ShoeString Acacia) as a top story first, then plant cover crop to protect the soil.

Once the Acacia Stenophylla (ShoeString Acacia) is established, plant the rest of the guilds and consortiums.

**Design for the future, not the present**.

- Build garden paths with compost and wood chips in year 1 and 2.
  - Transition to flag stone paths in year 3 in certain areas.
- Fruit Tree Guild
  - > **Note**: Fruit tree guilds are the ideal way to plant fruiting tree species. A guild is a group of plants that are grown together to support each other.
  - > Plant guild species around the fruit tree.
  - > Use fresh copy of base-map to ideate.
  - Pollinator Attractor
  - Pest Detractor
  - Biomass Accumulator
  - Nitrogen Fixer
  - Fruit Tree
- Consortium
  - > **Note**: A consortium is a group of plants that are grown together to support each other.
  - > Goal is to maximize the area you plant, for continuous yields.
  - One planting event to minimize soil disturbance.
  - Favours long-term species.
  - Plant species that have different lifecycle times, to maximize the area you plant.
  - Consortiums should be specific to the ecological niche (micro-climate) they are planted in.
  - Example Consortium
    - > **Note**: This is an example of a consortium, not a guild, though a lot of the same principles apply.
    - Jujube (chinese date) - main crop (fruit) (live for 100+ years)
    - Calendula - chop and drop and pollinator attractor (flowers for tea, salves) (live for 1 year)
    - Artichoke - biomass accumulator (flower for food) (live for 5+ years)
    - lilac - pollinator attractor (flowers for jam) (live for 20+ years, but slow growing)
    - ShoeString Acacia - nitrogen fixer, biomass accumulator, shade (chop and drop) (live for 30+ years)
    - Plantain biomass accumulator (salves) (live for 1 year)
    - Fava bean - nitrogen fixer (food) (live for 1 year)
    - Mustard Grass, Native grasses - biomass accumulator (soil cover crop, chop and drop) (live for 1 year)
