# Guide to Grow Portobella Mushrooms

## Introduction

Portobella mushrooms are a delicious and nutritious addition to any meal.  They are easy to grow and can be grown indoors or outdoors.  They are a great source of protein and can be used in a variety of dishes.  In this guide, we will cover the basics of growing portobella mushrooms, including the materials you will need, the steps to take, and how to care for your mushrooms once they are growing.

## Materials

To grow portobella mushrooms, you will need the following materials:

- Portobella mushroom spores, a healthy portobella mushroom, or a portobella mushroom [liquid culture](#liquid-culture)
- Growing Medium:
  - 5 Gallon Bucket of Straw
  - 7 quarts of Horse Manure
- Multiple 6 quart tubs/bins
- Agar and petri dishes
- Jars
- Pressure Cooker or large canning pot
- Seed Starting Mix
- Calcium Hydroxide (optional)
- Black Garbage Bags

## Steps

To grow portobella mushrooms, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Grain Spawn

1. Create the Grain Spawn:
    - Take liquid culture or piece of a healthy portobella mushroom
    - Place onto agar plate and let grow in a sterile location until completely colonized.
    - Once colonized, take a piece of the agar and place into a jar of sterilized grain.
    - Let sit in a warm and dark location, shaking occasionally to keep the substrate loose and prevent compaction, until completely colonized.

### Step 2: Prepare the Growing Medium

1. Prepare the Growing Medium:
   - Soak the straw in boiling water, let soak for 3 days, or soak in Calcium Hydroxide for 4-8 hours (this is called pasteurization).
   - Mix the straw and horse manure together in a large container.
   - Fill jars with the mixture and steam sterilize them for 60-90 minutes in a water bath.
   - Add 3 Quarts substrate and 1 quart of grain spawn to a black garbage bag lined 6 quart tub/bin. Mix well.
     - Ensure that the substrate is at field capacity.
2. Let grow for 10 days in a warm and dark location.
3. After 10 days, add the casing layer.
   - Add water to seed starting mix, mix well, and add 1/2" - 1" layer to the top of the substrate.
4. Mist the inside of a regular 6 quart bin and place upside down over the tub, as a humidity tent.
5. Mist the casing layer when it looks like it's drying out, enjoy the show, and harvest when ready.
6. Use the left-over substrate to start the next batch.

## Liquid Culture

Liquid culture is a method of growing mushroom mycelium in a liquid solution.  It is a quick and easy way to create a large amount of mycelium that can be used to inoculate a substrate.  To create a liquid culture, follow these steps:

> [IMPORTANT]\
> Liquid culture is a great way to grow mycelium, but it is important to use sterile techniques to prevent contamination.
> Typically, a pressure cooker is used to sterilize the liquid culture medium and the jars used to hold the liquid culture.
> Preparing special liquid culture jars with a self-healing injection port and a filter disk is a good idea to prevent contamination.

1. Prepare the liquid culture medium:
   - Mix 4 cups of water with 1/4 cup of malt extract or 1/8 cup of fresh honey in a pot.
   - Bring to a boil and let simmer for 10 minutes.
   - Pour the liquid into jars, seal, and let cool.
2. Inoculate the liquid culture:
    - Take a piece of colonized agar and place it into the liquid culture, or inject spores into the liquid culture.
    - Let sit in a warm and dark location until the liquid is completely colonized.
