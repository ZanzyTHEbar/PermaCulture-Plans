# Zones

Permaculture has the concept of `Zones`.

Zones are part of the decision making matrix. Zones are concerned with the level of human activity, efficiency of movement, and human effort on a Permaculture site. This page defines and explores the zone concept.

Zones do not have to have a specific shape. They can be any shape that makes sense for the property. They can be circles, squares, rectangles, or any other shape that makes sense for the property. They can also be any size that makes sense for the property. They can be small or large.

Depending on the size of the property, there may be multiple zones of each type, or missing zones. This is okay. The zones are a tool to help us plan the property. They are not a requirement.

Zones can follow the logic of permanence. The closer the zone is to the house, the more permanent it is. The further the zone is from the house, the less permanent it is.

> Zones are numbered from 1 to 5, and represent the intensity of use of these spaces in the design. Zone 0 is the house, or home center. Zone 1 is the zone nearest to the house, which would receive the most intensive management. Zone 5 is un-managed wilderness, or out-edges of the property. [^1]

## Zone 1

Zone 1 is the house, or home center. This is where we live and where we will be doing most of our work. This is where we will be doing our planning and where we will be storing our tools and supplies.

## Zone 2

Zone 2 is the zone nearest to the house, which would receive the most intensive management. This is where we will be growing our most used plants and where most of our purely aesthetic plants will be located.

> [!NOTE]\
> most used plants are located here: such as herbs and vegetables, raised beds, flowers, and easy-access gardens.

## Zone 3

Zone 3 is the zone where we will be growing our staple crops. This is where we will be growing our grains and other crops that we will be using to feed ourselves.

> [!NOTE]\
> staple crops are located here: such as grains, potatoes, and other crops that we will be using to feed ourselves.

## Zone 4

Zone 4 is the zone where we will be growing our orchards and other crops that we will be using to feed ourselves.

> [!NOTE]\
> orchards and other crops are located here: such as fruit trees, nut trees, and other crops that we will be using to feed ourselves.

## Zone 5

Zone 5 is un-managed (less actively managed) wilderness, or out-edges of the property.

> [!NOTE]\
> un-managed wilderness is located here: such as forest, meadow, and other areas that are less actively managed.
